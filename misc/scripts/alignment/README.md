forced alignment
----------------

state_align -- create training labels for merlin with HTK tools

phone_align -- create training labels for merlin with festvox tools

To train a new voice with Merlin, either state_align or phone_align labels are required, but not both. So, chose one as per your convenience and set the option accordingly in global_settings.cfg file.
