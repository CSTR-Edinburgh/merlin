--------

a) STRAIGHT - extracts 60-dim MGC, 25-dim BAP, 1-dim LF0 

b) WORLD - extracts 60-dim MGC, variable-dim BAP, 1-dim LF0 <br/>
(BAP dim: 1 for 16Khz, 5 for 48Khz) 

c) WORLD_v2 - extracts 60-dim MGC, 5-dim BAP, 1-dim LF0 <br/>
(dimensions of MGC and BAP can be fine-tuned)

We recommend using either STRAIGHT or WORLD. 

WORLD_v2 is still under development and requires some testing.
