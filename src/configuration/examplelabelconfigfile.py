# configuration for the input labels (features) for the DNN

# this currently supports
# * input labels can be any combination of HTS and XML style input labels
# * output features are numerical *only* (all strings are fully expanded into 1-of-n encodings, etc)
#
#
#
# this is all executable python code
#  so we need to define things before using them
#  that means the description is bottom-up

# how to extract features
# (just a few examples for now)
#
# each feature is a dictionary with various possible entries:
#   xpath: an XPATH that will extract the required feature from a segment target node of an Ossian XML utterance tree
#   hts:   a (list of) HTS pseudo regular expression(s) that match(es) part of an HTS label, resulting in a single boolean feature
#   mapper:   an optional function or dictionary which converts the feature value (e.g., a string) to a (vector of) numerical value(s)
#
# the dictionary describes how to compute that feature
# first, either xpath or hts describes how to extract the feature from a tree or label name
# then, an optional mapping converts the feature via a lookup table (also a dictionary) into a numerical value or vector
#
# if no mapper is provided, then the feature must already be a single numerical or boolean value
#
# some XPATH-based features

# in a future version, we could be more fleixble and allow more than one target_node type at once,
# with a set of XPATHs for each target_node - it would not be very hard to modify the code to do this

# the target nodes within the XML trees that the XPATH expressions apply to
target_nodes = "//segment"
# target_nodes = "//state" ???
