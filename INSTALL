INSTALL
=======

(1) go to tools/  and follow INSTALL instructions there.

(2) Merlin is coded in python and need third-party python libraries such as:

numpy, scipy, matplotlib, lxml
    Usually shipped with your python packages
    Available in Ubuntu packages
theano
    Can be found on pip
    Need version 0.6 and above
    http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
bandmat
    Can be found on pip
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bandmat

For running on NVIDIA GPU, you will need also CUDA
    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone
and you might want also CUDNN [optionnal]
    https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
    
Computationnal efficiency is obviously greatly improved using GPU.
It is also improved using the latest versions of theano.
