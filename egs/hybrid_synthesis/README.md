# Hybrid speech synthesis

## ATTENTION: still in experimental phase...won't work straight-forward...requires lot of debugging!!

Hybrid speech synthesis is one of the main driving force behind most of the commercial systems that are present today. 

Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as well as including examples of various modules. Multisyn is an open-source toolkit for building unit selection voice with any speech corpus. This post gives detailed instructions on how to use Multisyn to build an unit selection model and Festival for final waveform synthesis.
