  s1: To run nick_hurricane with STRAIGHT vocoder and combilex phoneset
      The data is not publicly available as it includes features extracted from STRAIGHT and 
      labels using Combilex phoneset (both of them have restricted usage).

      Therefore, the scripts are meant for internal purpose and also for those who have license to both.
      For password, please mail me, only if you have license to both.
