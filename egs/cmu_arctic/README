About the SLT Arctic corpus

The CMU_ARCTIC databases were constructed at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University as phonetically balanced, US English single speaker databases designed for unit selection speech synthesis research.

The databases consist of around 1150 utterances carefully selected from out-of-copyright texts from Project Gutenberg. The databses include US English male (bdl) and female (slt) speakers (both experinced voice talent) as well as other accented speakers.

Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.
