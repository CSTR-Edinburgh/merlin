About the roger blizzard2008 corpus

The roger database was constructed at the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh for the Blizzard Challange 2008. The database was only available to registered participants in the challange (see http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/roger_blizzard2008/).

It contains 9609 utterances (~15h) from one english speaker (roger) at 16 kHz

Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.
